)F Function STEMPULL

 Using STEMPULL

     This program provides an external REXX function to retrive REXX
     stem variables from the stack created by the STEMPUSH function.

     The 'stack' is in fact a dataspace whose STOKEN is passed (in
     EBCDIC) from the STEMPUSH function.  This 'token' is used by this
     program to access the dataspace and set up the REXX variables.

     After the stack has been processed it is deleted unless the user
     specifies the 'NODELETE' keyword.

)X Syntax
              rcode = STEMPULL(token,delflag)

)O Keywords
))RCODE

              rcode  -  Return code :
                        0  - One or more stem variables
                             have been 'pulled' from
                             the stack.
                        1  - Stack is full - truncation
                             occurred in STEMPUSH
                        2  - Stack is empty.
                        4  - No stack found that
                             matches the 'token'.
                        8  - Token missing or delflag
                             invalid.

))TOKEN
              token  -  The 16-byte token returned by
                        STEMPUSH that identifies the
                        stem variable 'stack'.

))DELFLAG
              delflag-  Indicator that specifies if the
                        dataspace is deleted after
                        being processed.
                        Possible values :
                        'DELETE'   - Always delete the
                                     dataspace. This
                                     is the deafult.
                        'NODELETE' - Do not delete the
                                     dataspace.


)Example
                /* REXX - EXEC1 */
                fname.0 = 2
                fname.1 = 'Fred'
                fname.2 = 'Barney'
                sname.0 = 2
                sname.1 = 'Flinstone'
                sname.2 = 'Rubble'
                token = stempush('fname.','sname.')
                if token <> 0 then call EXEC2 token
                exit

                /* REXX - EXEC2 */
                arg token
                rcode = STEMPULL(token,'NODELETE')
                if rcode = 0 then do
                  say fname.1 sname.1
                  say fname.2 sname.2
                end
                exit
